# ⌨️ KeyLogger React App

A simple yet interactive **React-based KeyLogger** that listens to keyboard events in real-time and displays which key was pressed and whether it's currently down or up. Useful as a beginner project to understand React hooks and event listeners.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Displays the current state of the key (Up or Down)
- 🟢 Start/Stop Logging buttons with UI feedback
- 🧼 Auto-clears logs when logging stops
- 🎨 Minimal styling using inline styles

## 🛠 Tech Stack
